The Manufacturing Innovation Center assists client companies with applied manufacturing R&D to help them meet 
specific business objectives – increasing productivity, profitability, domestic and international competitiveness, 
and the number and quality of products offered – so that they can grow and create jobs. The center partners with NY 
State systems integrators to offer clients complete solutions to a wide range of manufacturing problems in the 
Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 1-8 range (i.e. problem definition / pilot plant demonstration) after 
de-risking development in our labs.
The center is directly linked to or affiliated with three Manufacturing USA hubs (smart manufacturing, robotics, 
and biopharmaceuticals), a teaching factory (Manufacturing Innovation Learning Lab) and a supply chain management 
center located at Rensselaer.
