The Center for Future Energy Systems (CFES) is a New York State Center for Advanced Technology (CAT) funded by 
Empire State Development through the New York State Foundation for Science, Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR).
Since its inception in 2004, CFES has established a strong track record in supporting the development of future 
energy systems through research, industry collaboration, and education. CFES also provides the locus of energy 
research at Rensselaer to connect world-leading expertise of faculty and staff with the needs of the energy 
industry to spur economic development in New York. In 2015, CFES was redesignated by NYSTAR as a CAT for the
second 10-year funding cycle.
